        "- Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a maximum-margin classifier. It finds the hyperplane that separates classes with the largest margin (distance to the nearest training points). Only a few points on the edge‚Äîsupport vectors‚Äîdetermine the boundary. For linear data it fits a straight hyperplane; for nonlinear data it uses kernels (see Q3). Training typically minimizes hinge loss with a margin penalty."
